1.  [Non-project mode](nonproject_mode/)

**Coming soon to InTime 2.7 onwards**

Currently InTime only supports Tcl based flow either in project mode or via a dcp. *New non-project mode capabilities will be released for the next version.* 

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to use InTime in non-project mode. It reads in a list of files. 

```Tcl
# 
# Synthesis run script generated by Vivado
# 
read_verilog {
  alu.v
  data_mux.v
  ins_decode.v
  ins_rom.v
  io.v
  prgm_cntr.v
  reg_file.v
  spcl_regs.v
  eight_bit_uc.v
}
read_xdc eight_bit_uc.sdc
```
After that it executes the compilation steps. Note that in this case the "top" and "part" is specified
```Tcl
synth_design -top eight_bit_uc -part xc7k70tfbg484-2

write_checkpoint -force -noxdef eight_bit_uc_synth.dcp

set rc [catch {
  opt_design 
  write_checkpoint -force eight_bit_uc_opt.dcp
} RESULT]
if {$rc} {
  return -code error $RESULT
}

...
...
```
