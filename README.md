# Run InTime in Tcl Mode (Vivado)
This repository contains scripts to run InTime in the Tcl Console or on the command-line. 

## Main Contents
1. [examples](examples/) : Sample designs for the various flows described here.
2. [scripts](scripts/) : Sample scripts you can try to see how the optimization flow works with your FPGA toolchains.
3. [scripts/intime/configuration](scripts/intime/configuration/) : Ways to set up InTime for your FPGA toolchains.

Currently, both project and non-project modes are supported, however in non-project mode, only a post-synthesis **DCP** file is supported at this time. 

To use the InTime GUI, refer to this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQvY_XZ3R7w).
